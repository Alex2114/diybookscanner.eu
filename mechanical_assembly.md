## Assembling the base
### Preparing the aluminium tubes
You will need:
* 2x aluminium square tube 30x710mm
* 4x metal tube inserts 32x8x1.2mm  
* 2x aluminium square tube 25x710mm
* 4x metal tube inserts 25x8x1.2mm  
* rubber hammer

Separate the 30mm tubes and inserts from the 25mm tubes and inserts. Bang the tube inserts into both sides of both aluminium tubes using the rubber hammer. This requires some force.

### Assembling the base side plates
You will need:
* 2x base side plate
* 4x M8x50 bolts
* assembled 30x30mm aluminium tubes (see previous step)
* 1x allen key M5

Assemble the base by screwing the furniture cap nuts onto the threaded rod. (Sorry about the bad picture from a test build.)

### Assembling the cradle frame
You will need:
* 2x aluminium square tube 25x696mm
* 4x tube insert 25mm M8
* 4x furniture cap nut M6
* 2x cradle lifter
* 2x threaded rod M6 730mm

The process is similar to the assembly of the base frame.

First push two furniture cap nuts each into both cradle lifters.
![furniture cap nuts into cradle lifter](pictures/furniture_cap_nuts_into_cradle_lifter.jpg "furniture cap nuts into cradle lifter")

Now fasten the threaded rods into the furniture cap nuts in one cradle lifter. Do not fasten them too tightly yet.
![furniture cap nuts connect cradle rods](pictures/furniture_cap_nuts_connect_cradle_rods.jpg "furniture cap nuts connect cradle rods")

Push the aluminium tubes onto the threaded rods.
![push aluminium tubes onto threaded rods](pictures/push_aluminium_tubes_onto_threaded_rods.jpg "push aluminium tubes onto threaded rods")

Now add the second cradle lifter to the assembly. Fasten all four furniture cap bolts to the threaded rods.
![fasten furniture cap bolts to threaded rods](pictures/fasten_furniture_cap_bolts_to_threaded_rods.jpg "fasten furniture cap bolts to threaded rods")

### Base pulley bolts
You will need:
* 2x bolt M8 50mm
* 2x nut M8
* allen key M6

Screw one bolt halfway through each side plate. Keep the bolt head on the outside of the frame. Screw a nut onto the bolt at the inside of the frame.

## Assembling the glass module
### Front and back plate meet camera braces
You will need:
* front plate

![furniture bolt and cross dowel](pictures/furniture_bolt_and_cross_dowel.jpg "furniture bolt and cross dowel")

**The flat head screw side facing outwards**, insert the cross dowels into the holes in the camera braces. Push the furniture bolts through the front and back slot plates. Adjust the cross dowel angle alignment to the the furniture bolt with a flat head screwdriver. Screw the furniture bolts into the cross dowels.

![screw furniture bolt into cross dowel](pictures/screw_furniture_bolt_into_cross_dowel.jpg "screw furniture bolt into cross dowel")

### Preparing the glass plates
You will need:
* 2x glass plate
* electric tape

Put the two glass plates onto a flat surface. They should meet with the angled cut facing down.
![glass together angled cut facing down](pictures/glass_together_angled_cut_facing_down.jpg "glass together angled cut facing down")

Tape the two glass plates together with bits of electric tape. Six or seven should do.
![glass plates taped together](pictures/glass_plates_taped_together.jpg "glass plates taped together")

### Installing the glass plates
You will need:
* prepared glass plates
* assembled optics module
* 2x aluminium L profile 600mm
* 12x short wood screw
* electric drill or screwdriver

Lay the glass on the optics module as shown **with the angle cut pointing down**. Gently fold both aluminum profiles around the corners where glass and front/back plate meet.
![glass plates and aluminium profiles on optics module](pictures/glass_plates_and_aluminium_profiles_on_glass_module.jpg "glass plates and aluminium profiles on optics module")

Using a 3mm wood drill bit, and with the holes in the aluminium profiles as a guid, predrill twelve holes for the wood screws in the front/back plate.

Now we are ready to fix the glass plates to the glass module. Screw twelve screws into the predrilled holes. **Do not screw them in too tight yet!**
