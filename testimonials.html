<p><strong>Hans (Norway)</strong> assembled our full kit. His <a href="http://shavenook.com/thread-i-ve-built-a-book-scanner-very-picture-heavy">detailed review of the build process</a>:<br />
<i>Compared to some of the rigs others have build, it is very simple [...]
I would like to think that all off us would be able to assemble something like this; [...] putting this together was easy. Tab A into slot B, and then a screw to keep it together. The real glory goes to the guys who came up with the design to begin with.

Still need to fiddle with it; the light from the living room window causes a bit of glare, meaning I get best results at night... and the summer nights in Norway isn't very dark at all. </i>

<p><strong>Tamás (Hungary)</strong> built our kit and liberated some books in his native language. His <a href="http://archive.org/search.php?query=aladar%20AND%20collection%3Aopensource">uploads to archive.org</a>. (Do mind some factors that limit the quality of what you get to see. These scans were done with an older camera model than what we ship now, and they have been compressed quite a bit, the pdf documents even more than the images.) </p>

<p><strong>XAOP (Belgium)</strong> built our kit and made a timelapse video of the process. <iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LFnabTBh8XE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Philip Mariën, Hasselt, Belgium</strong>: <br/><i>"I was diybookscanner.eu's first
customer, before they even had a site. I had seen a forum posting
where Mark announced a book scanner kit in the EU soon and contacted
him. He had exactly one kit ready. In Belgium, 50 km from where I
live! He invited me for a private build workshop as a test customer.
Keeping that in mind, building the scanner was a smooth ride.
Impressive quality wooden parts made mechanical construction easy.
Some rough edges on software. We improved documentation and even
squashed a software bug, live on github. After five hours of hard
work, we had everything mostly working. A great experience for two
tinkerers like both Mark and me."</i></p>
