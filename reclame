Hi all,

Starting today, http://diybookscanner.eu is offering a complete book scanner kit to EU customers for 899â‚¬. Complete means cameras, lighting, electronics and shipping are included.


Sincerely,

Mark Van den Borre

P.S. I absolutely want to acknowledge that our kit is 99% based upon the great community work spearheaded by Dan, Rob and so many others here.
P.P.S. As any good community member, I try to work in the open and make some humble contributions of my own. I am known in the forum as markvdb. Some activities in the weeks since I've actively worked with the latest design:
* openscad porting work: http://github.com/markvdb/diybookscanner/openscad (in progress, helping hands welcome!)
* an experiment with aluminium L profiles as brackets for the glass
* documenting Canon A2200 ptp triggering: http://github.com/markvdb/diybookscanner/misc/settings.md
