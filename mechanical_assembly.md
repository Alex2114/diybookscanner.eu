### Preparing the aluminium tubes
You will need:
* 2x aluminium square tube 30x694mm
* 4x tube insert 30x30mm M8 
* 2x aluminium square tube 25x696mm
* 4x tube insert 25x25mm M8 
* rubber hammer

Separate the 30mm tubes and inserts from the 25mm tubes and inserts. Bang the tube inserts into both sides of both aluminium tubes using the rubber hammer. This requires some force.

### Assembling the base side plates
You will need:
* 2x base side plate
* 2x threaded rod M6 730mm (10mm shorter than the other set of two rods!)
* 4x furniture cap nut M6
* assembled 30x30mm aluminium tubes (see previous step)
* 2x allen key M6

Screw a furniture cap nut onto one side of both theaded rods.

### Mounting the pulleys onto the base side plates
You will need:
* 2x bolt M8 70mm
* 6x washer M8
* 4x wooden pulley
* 2x nut M8
* allen key M6
* wrench M8

Put together as seen in the pictures below. From outside to inside:

### Assembling the cradle frame
You will need:
* 2x aluminium square tube 25x696mm
* 4x tube insert 25mm M8
* 4x furniture cap nut M6
* 2x cradle lifter
* 2x threaded rod M6 740mm

The process is similar to the assembly of the base frame.

First push two furniture cap nuts into one cradle lifter.
