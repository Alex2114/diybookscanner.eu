<p>Philip Mariën, Hasselt, Belgium: <br/><i>"I was diybookscanner.eu's first
customer, before they even had a site. I had seen a forum posting
where Mark announced a book scanner kit in the EU soon and contacted
him. He had exactly one kit ready. In Belgium, 50 km from where I
live! He invited me for a private build workshop as a test customer.
Keeping that in mind, building the scanner was a smooth ride.
Impressive quality wooden parts made mechanical construction easy.
Some rough edges on software. We improved documentation and even
squashed a software bug, live on github. After five hours of hard
work, we had everything mostly working. A great experience for two
tinkerers like both Mark and me."</i></p>
