<p>Hans (Norway) assembled our full kit. His <a href="http://shavenook.com/thread-i-ve-built-a-book-scanner-very-picture-heavy">detailed review of the build process</a>. Quote:<br />
<i>Compared to some of the rigs others have build, it is very simple - at least the electronic side of things; some have rigged up motion detectors so their cameras snap when they flip the page over.
I would like to think that all off us would be able to assemble something like this; having seen the work some of you guys pulls off in restoring razors and brushes, putting this together was easy. Tab A into slot B, and then a screw to keep it together. The real glory goes to the guys who came up with the design to begin with.

Still need to fiddle with it; the light from the living room window causes a bit of glare, meaning I get best results at night... and the summer nights in Norway isn't very dark at all. </i>

<p>Tamás (Hungary) built our kit and liberated some books in his native language. His <a href="http://archive.org/search.php?query=aladar%20AND%20collection%3Aopensource">uploads to archive.org</a>.</p>

<p>Philip Mariën, Hasselt, Belgium: <br/><i>"I was diybookscanner.eu's first
customer, before they even had a site. I had seen a forum posting
where Mark announced a book scanner kit in the EU soon and contacted
him. He had exactly one kit ready. In Belgium, 50 km from where I
live! He invited me for a private build workshop as a test customer.
Keeping that in mind, building the scanner was a smooth ride.
Impressive quality wooden parts made mechanical construction easy.
Some rough edges on software. We improved documentation and even
squashed a software bug, live on github. After five hours of hard
work, we had everything mostly working. A great experience for two
tinkerers like both Mark and me."</i></p>
