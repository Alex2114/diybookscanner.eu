<h2>about diybookscanner.eu</h2>
 <div class="content">
<p>Diybookscanner.eu sells book scanners, both as a kit and preassembled. It is a for-profit spinoff of <a href="http://markvdb.be">my</a> involvement in the <a href="http://diybookscanner.org">DIYbookscanner.org community</a>. DIYbookscanner.org producs advanced book scanning technology designs available to all who need it.</p>

<p>Diybookscanner.eu is an expression of a cherished  <a href="http://blog.markvdb.be">personal</a> goal: simple quality without the bells and whistles. Being able to create significant added value using free software and open hardware fills me with joy.</p>

<p>Diybookscanner.eu resorts under <a href="contact.html">lusis.lv sia</a> of Riga, Latvia. I established Lusis.lv sia in August 2012 as the little sister company to <a href="http://lusis.be">lusis.be</a>, the Belgian company I started in early 2006. I couldn't have started lusis.lv sia without the help of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ivo.ielitis">Ivo Ielitis</a>.</p>
