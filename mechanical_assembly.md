## Aseembling the base
### Preparing the aluminium tubes
You will need:
* 2x aluminium square tube 30x694mm
* 4x tube insert 30x30mm M8 
* 2x aluminium square tube 25x696mm
* 4x tube insert 25x25mm M8 
* rubber hammer

Separate the 30mm tubes and inserts from the 25mm tubes and inserts. Bang the tube inserts into both sides of both aluminium tubes using the rubber hammer. This requires some force.

### Assembling the base side plates
You will need:
* 2x base side plate
* 2x threaded rod M6 730mm (10mm shorter than the other set of two rods!)
* 4x furniture cap nut M6
* assembled 30x30mm aluminium tubes (see previous step)
* 2x allen key M6

Screw a furniture cap nut onto one side of both theaded rods.
![banging inserts into tubes](pictures/cap_nut_on_threaded_rod.jpg "Screw cap nut onto threaded rods")

Insert the threaded rods into the base side plate holes. Put the rods through the aluminium tubes.
![rods through base side plate](pictures/rods_through_base_plate.jpg "Screw cap nut onto threaded rods")

Push two furniture cap nuts into the other base side plate.
![furniture cap nuts in base plate two](pictures/furniture_cap_nut_in_base_plate_2.jpg "furniture cap nuts in other base side plate")

Assemble the base by screwing the furniture cap nuts onto the threaded rod.

### Mounting the pulleys onto the base side plates
You will need:
* 2x bolt M8 70mm
* 6x washer M8
* 4x wooden pulley
* 2x nut M8
* allen key M6
* wrench M8

Put together as seen in the pictures below. From outside to inside:
* bolt head
* wooden pulley
* washer
* base side plate
* washer
* wooden pulley
* washer
* nut

### Assembling the cradle frame
You will need:
* 2x aluminium square tube 25x696mm
* 4x tube insert 25mm M8
* 4x furniture cap nut M6
* 2x cradle lifter
* 2x threaded rod M6 740mm
* allen key M6

The process is similar to the assembly of the base frame.

First push two furniture cap nuts each into both cradle lifters.
![furniture cap nuts into cradle lifter](pictures/furniture_cap_nuts_into_cradle_lifter.jpg "furniture cap nuts into cradle lifter")

Now fasten the threaded rods into the furniture cap nuts in one cradle lifter. Do not fasten them too tightly yet.
![furniture cap nuts connect cradle rods](pictures/furniture_cap_nuts_connect_cradle_rods.jpg "furniture cap nuts connect cradle rods")

Push the aluminium tubes onto the threaded rods.
![push aluminium tubes onto threaded rods](pictures/push_aluminium_tubes_onto_threaded_rods.jpg "push aluminium tubes onto threaded rods")

Now add the second cradle lifter to the assembly. Fasten all four furniture cap bolts to the threaded rods.
![fasten furniture cap bolts to threaded rods](pictures/fasten_furniture_cap_bolts_to_threaded_rods.jpg "fasten furniture cap bolts to threaded rods")

### Base pulley bolts
You will need:
* 2x bolt M8 50mm
* 2x nut M8
* allen key M6

Screw one bolt halfway through each side plate. Keep the bolt head on the outside of the frame. Screw a nut onto the bolt at the inside of the frame.

### Cradle frame in base frame
Move the cradle frame inside the base frame. **Watch the orientation!**

![cradle inside base frame](pictures/cradle_inside_base_frame.jpg "cradle inside base frame")

### Preparing the cradle lift arms
You will need:
* 2x long cradle lift arm
* 2x short cradle lift arm
* 16x bearing
* 8x bolt M8 50mm
* 1x nut M8
* allen key M6
* wrench M8

Push two bearings each into both sides of all four cradle lift arms, for sixteen bearings in total. Use an M8 bolt and nut as pictured. Afterwards, unscrew the nut. Leave the eight bolts inserted.

![lift arm bearings](pictures/lift_arm_bearings.jpg "lift arm bearings")

### Mount the cradle lift arms
You will need:
* assembled cradle lift arms
* 8x washer M8
* 8x nut M8
* allen key M6
* wrench M8

Put a washer on every lift arm bolt.
![lift arm bolt washer](pictures/lift_arm_bolt_washer.jpg "lift arm bolt washer")

Bolt the lift arms to cradle lifters and side plates. Screw an M8 nut onto every lift arm bolt.
![mount cradle lift arms](pictures/mount_cradle_lift_arms.jpg "mount cradle lift arms")

### Preparing the hand grip tube
You will need:
* aluminium round tube
* round tube inserts
* threaded rod 830mm
* rubber hammer

Bang the round tube inserts into both sides of the aluminium round tube.
![bang inserts into round tube](pictures/bang_inserts_into_round_tube.jpg "bang inserts into round tube")

Push the threaded rod through the tube with the ends out on both sides.
![push threaded rod through round tube](pictures/push_threaded_rod_through_round_tube.jpg "push threaded rod through round tube")

### Mounting the hand grip tube
You will need
* assembled hand grip tube
* 2x washer M8
* 4x nut M8

Mount the hand grip tube between the lift arms. Push the threaded rod through the mount holes in both lift arms.
![mount hand grip tube between lift arms](pictures/mount_hand_grip_tube_between_lift_arms.jpg "mount hand grip tube between lift arms")

On both sides of the threaded rod, first push on a washer, then screw on two nuts. Leave some space between the nuts. This is where we will attach the bungee cords later.

## Assembling the middle
### Front and back plate meet camera braces
You will need:
* front plate
* back plate
* 2x camera brace
* rubber hammer

Assemble the front and back plate and the camera braces as pictured. This might require some force from the rubber hammer. Don't worry about damaging the wood. This is super strong birch plywood!
![assemble front, back and camera braces 1](pictures/front_back_camera_braces_1.jpg) "assemble front, back and camera braces 1"
![assemble front, back and camera braces 2](pictures/front_back_camera_braces_2.jpg) "assemble front, back and camera braces 2"

The end result should look like this.
