<h2>Diybookscanner.eu, a good community citizen</h2>
 <div class="content">

<p>At diybookscanner.eu, we try really hard to be good community citizens. All the progress we make while producing the diybookscanner gets published under free-as-in-freedom licenses. We proudly share our work. Always. With everyone. We strongly believe that is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>When you buy our product, you don't buy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damaged_good">crippleware</a>. Our product doesn't die of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">planned obsolescense</a>. If anything, our product will grow in possibilities.</p>
