## Assembling the base
### Preparing the aluminium tubes
You will need:
* 2x aluminium square tube 30x710mm
* 4x metal tube inserts 32x8x1.2mm  
* 2x aluminium square tube 25x710mm
* 4x metal tube inserts 25x8x1.2mm  
* rubber hammer

Separate the 30mm tubes and inserts from the 25mm tubes and inserts. Bang the tube inserts into both sides of both aluminium tubes using the rubber hammer. This requires some force.

### Assembling the base side plates
You will need:
* 2x base side plate
* 4x M8x50 bolts
* assembled 30x30mm aluminium tubes (see previous step)
